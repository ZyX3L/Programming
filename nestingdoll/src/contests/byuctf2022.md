This was a fairly beginner friendly CTF, we enjoyed all the challenges, up to the point where the guess-work and obscure software began, you could technically piece everything together yourself, but it is a mental task beyond any other.

Our favorite challenge was `Chad "The Jaw"`.

Overall, all the challenges were well made, the infrastructure was stable and reliable, there was a good variety and it was fun!

Our ratings are:
